## **👾 Program name**

## **📄 Turn in files**

- `.c`, `libft.h`, `Makefile`

## **✍🏼 Description**

- **Write your own library, containing an extract of important functions for your cursus.
You are free to add any function to your libft as you see fit.**


### Part 1 - Libc functions

To begin, you must redo a set of functions from the libc. Your functions will have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They must comply with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference will be their names. They will begin with the ’ft_’ prefix. For instance, `strlen` becomes `ft_strlen`.
